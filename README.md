# CIS171-Practice-Labs

This repository is intended to be a collection of practice labs to be used by FHU students in CIS171 who are looking for extra exposure to python. Please feel free to make use of any files provided here. The practice labs will likely not be set up with automatic test so you must determine yourself, or ask someone else, if the code is running correctly. I will look into adding automated testing to the files in the future. As a reminder, SI Sessions will be held on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 5:00pm to 6:00pm.

_Any questions or concerns about this repository should be directed first to your SI unless you deem it necessary to notify professor Nichols_
