#This is a practice lab. Complete the following tasks to the best of your ability and ask questions when you feel stuck.

#In this practice lab you will create a grid of 'playing cards' which the user can interact with through the terminal

'''
Task 1
Create a list called card_displays that contains 9 of these strings: '[]'
'''

#Your code goes here

'''
Task 2
Create a list called card_values that contains 9 unique single characters
Make sure they are all string type variables
'''
  
#Your code goes here

#Do not delete or alter this for loop
for _ in range(2):
  
  '''
  Task 3
  Use loops to display all nine card displays in a 3x3 grid
  '''
  
  #Your code goes here
  
  '''
  Task 4
  Prompt the user to enter the row and column of the card they wish to turn over 
  '''
  
  #Your code goes here
  
  '''
  Task 5

  '''
  
  #Your code goes here
  
  '''
  Task 6
  Use the calculated index to set the selected cards display to be its value
  '''
  
  #Your code goes here

'''
